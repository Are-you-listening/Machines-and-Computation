### How to start?
    Run main.cpp    Enjoy =)

#### Supported Included List:

- [X] The code gives the same output as usual (Code Behavior should be the same)

#### Requirements:
1. Comments are removed 
2. All code must be placed in a single file 
3. The to-be-processed code should compile and run without errors 
4. Function names consisting of A* may not exist in de pre-processed code (except for TM)
5. This string may not be used in the codebase: "a665a45920422f9d417e4867efdc4fb8a04a1f3fff1fa07e998e86f7f7a27ae3" (for threading)
